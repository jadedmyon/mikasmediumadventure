Breakfast.
What is breakfast anyways?
Break... fast?
What did Mr. Fast do to deserve being broken?
Oh.
A fast, as in not eating for a while?
And you're "breaking" it, like, you're stopping the fast to eat?
Does sleeping count as a fast?
And does the amount I ate count as "breaking"?
Good thing the window was open, or else there'd be a breakwindow too.
