Hey, was that you just now?
s;Mika
Uh, depends. What did I do again?

There was a girl that looked just like you that proposed... to ANOTHER girl!
How scandalous!
s;Mika
Uh, I would NEVER do such a thing. Hahaha. Girl love? Not me.
s;Human
That's great, otherwise I would have to call the police! Hahaha.
What's even more salacious, the other girl accepted! 
s;Mika
...What.
(How the fuck did Debut Mika score before me.)
(How, the fuck.)
