speaker; 
hideicon;
I've been expelled to the hospital.
Kicked out.
No.
I'm giving myself too little credit.
I could have used all of the mental tricks to appease them. Pretend that it's all fine, and that regular life was just around the corner.
I could have acted like a good girl.
But I didn't. It must have been on purpose.
I was not sent to the hospital.
I practically walked there myself.
